## Getting started

1. Create your organization and get your credentials by following one of our [onboarding tutorials](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/welcome).

2. Set the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SLUG` on your hosting provider to your organization slug (subdomain) and be sure to build the forked repository using the node environment (`NODE_ENV`) as production.

3. Deploy the forked repository to your preferred hosting service or host it yourself. You can deploy with one click below:

4. Build your sales channel with your favorite technologies and frameworks by leveraging our [developer resources](https://commercelayer.io/developers) and [documentation](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api).

5. Get an [access token](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/authentication) for your application. You should generate this in your sales channel or use our Javascript [authentication library](https://github.com/commercelayer/commercelayer-js-auth).

6. Create an [order](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/v/api-reference/orders) associated with some [line items](https://docs.commercelayer.io/developers/v/api-reference/line_items).

7. View the cart associated with the previously created order using the URL format: `<your-deployed-cart-url>/:order_id?accessToken=<your-access-token>`.

### Example

`https://cart.yourbrand.com/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9`

## Hosted version

Any Commerce Layer account comes with a hosted version of the Cart application that is automatically enabled. You can customize it by adding your organization logo, favicon, primary color, and Google Tag Manager ID.

You can use the hosted version of the Cart application with the following URL format: `https://<your-organization-subdomain>.commercelayer.app/cart/:order_id?accessToken=<your-access-token>`

### Example

`https://yourbrand.commercelayer.app/cart/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9`

## Embedding the cart

The cart can be embedded in your application or website by loading the hosted URL in an inline frame. This way a compact version of the Cart app that doesn't show the header and the footer will be automatically rendered.

### Example

```
// hosted
<iframe src="https://cart.yourbrand.com/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9" width="100%" />

// forked
<iframe src="https://yourbrand.commercelayer.app/cart/PrnYhoVeza?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9" width="100%" />
```

> You can either set your iFrame to a fixed height or keep it responsive using the [iFrame Resizer](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer) library â€” the Cart app already includes the `iframeResizer.contentWindow` scripts, so you only need to add it to your parent app.
